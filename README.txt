Getting and Cleaning Data
Week 4 Project
==========================================================================
The data for this project consists of two parts:
   - A Zip file named "UCI HAR Dataset Zip.7z"
   - A folder named "Analysis Files"

The "UIC HAR Dataset.7z" Zip file contains the smartphone data that was the input 
to the analysis. This data was obtained from the website

   https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

and was downloaded on November 19th, 2020. The README.txt file in the 
Zip file describes the contents of the data set.

The folder "Analysis" contains the results of the analysis performed. This 
consists of the following files
   - run_analysis.R contains the R function "run_analysis" that reads 
     the downloaded smartphone data and produces the analyzed results
   - output_data.csv contains the results of the analysis in comma 
     separated variable format
   - Code Book.txt contains a description of the analyzed data contained 
     in output_data.csv
